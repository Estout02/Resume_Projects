**Resume_Projects**

This repo is designed to the code i created for the projects that i reference on my current resume as of July 2020.
Some of the code is in better shape than others and some of the code is commented better than others. I provide
this code in the hopes that you will see that I have done some worthwhile interesting projects, and not to 
neccasrily provide 100% bug free, prefectly documented code. The Asteroids project is the earliest project of mine
contained in the repo and might be the roughest.
