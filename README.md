# Eric Stout Resume Repo
> This repo is designed to be an easy way to share the code for the projects that I reference on my resume.
These are all projects that I have done during the course of my Masters of Software Development graduate program.
The code is provided as a candid look at some of my finished projects to give an idea of my current skill and 
some growth that I have made from project to project.
